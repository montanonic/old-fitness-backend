# Design

This documentation directory will serve the purpose of describing how
parts of the site should look and behave. In other words, we will describe our
***user experience*** and ***design*** goals here, to use as guidelines when
building the site.

It will not explain *how* to achieve those goals in any great detail, at least
not on the technical side of things. For implementation explanations, look in
the `Model` and `Handler` folders.
