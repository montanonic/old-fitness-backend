-- | Yesod automatically generates Primary Keys (ID's) for each Table row, so
-- | the data below does not have to explicitly encode it. The reference to a
-- | Row's primary key will just be the table-name + 'Id'. So, to reference a
-- | user's unique ID, you'd write `UserId`.
-- |
-- | The basic table syntax is a capitalized table-name, followed by indented
-- | entries, each specifying a row Field (the first word), and the Value for
-- | that Field (the second word, which corresponds to a PSQL data type).
-- |
-- | For more information on the syntax used here, see:
-- | https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/wiki/Persistent-entity-syntax
-- | The "Conversion table" from that link contains all of the standard
-- | Persistent data types.
-- |
-- | Data types that are not specified in the "Conversion table" are types
-- | created specifically for this application, know as "Sum types". For
-- | example, `Gender` is not a standard Persistent Value. All such data is
-- | created in the Model/Data/ directory. Please consult it for more
-- | information about the usage of a specific data type.
-- |
-- | Most tables will contain `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields. The latter
-- | will be NULL upon creation. Fields in the table which allow UPDATE
-- | actions will be listed in the comment to `updatedAt`.
-- |
-- | If you want to search for a particular table, prefix it with # and then
-- | search. For example, `#Friendship` will take you to the Friendship table.
-- |
-- | If a table has an updatedAt field, it can be Updated. Otherwise, it allows
-- | only Creation and Reading (querying). If deletion is allowed, it have a
-- | 'can delete' comment.
-- |
-- | If a table has documentation on it, there will be a 'documented' comment
-- | next to its search tag. Consult the documentation/Model/ directory.
-- |
-- | If a field uses a custom data type, the table comment will have a 'data'
-- | entry followed by a list of all custom datatypes used in the table.


-- TODO:

-- Add entities for logging message/comment data, so that we can have edit
-- histories.

-- Add logging entities for likes.

-- Figure out if it's better for like entities to be separated to be specific
-- to comments or posts, or to be consolidated into a single Like entity with
-- NULLable fields referring either to a CommentId or PostId, as it is now.

Friendship
    firstUser UserId -- This *must always* be the user who *sent* the friend
      -- request

    becameFriends UTCTime Maybe -- if NULL, the first user sent a request, and

    UniqueFriendship firstUser secondUser -- in queries we might need to also
      -- search for UniqueFriendship secondUser firstUser as well, to ensure
      -- that we find the relationship. Just a reminder in case behavior is
      -- ever buggy in this table.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--#FriendshipLog ; documented in Models.md

-- | The idea with this is to make sure that we have a full history of any
-- Friendship-level actions.
-- Logging will only occur when a field in Friendship is overwritten.

FriendshipLog
    friendship FriendshipId
    user UserId -- who performed the action

    action FriendshipAction -- SendRequest, AcceptRequest, or Defriend.
    timestamp UTCTime

    createdAt UTCTime -- NOTE: When the log was recorded is distinct from when
      -- the action was made (the 'timestamp'). These values should never be
      -- identical, as logs are not made at the same time actions are taken.

----------------------------------CONVERSATIONS---------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--#ConversationUser ; documented

-- | Points a User to a Conversation. When created the isActive field will be
-- true, indicating that they will receive updates to the conversation and it
-- will remain visible to them.

ConversationUser
    conversation ConversationId
    user UserId

    isActive Bool -- This field determines if the user will have the
      -- conversation displayed in their messages tab within the App.
      -- See documentation for more information on how this field is used.

    createdAt UTCTime
    updatedAt UTCTime Maybe -- Allowed fields: isActive.
      -- If this field is not null, and isActive is false, the user de-activated
      -- the conversation at this time; if isActive is true, then the user at
      -- one point de-activated the conversation, and re-activated it at this
      -- time.

    UniqueConversationUser conversation user -- only 1 user per conversation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--#ConversationMessage ; documented

-- | A single conversation contains 1 or more messages. This table contains

    createdAt UTCTime
    updatedAt UTCTime Maybe -- Allowed fields: message(?).
        -- non-null entries in this field will indicate the time the last edit
        -- was made to a message (supposing we allow edits)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--#Conversation ; documented

-- | The entries for this table are sparse. That's because it will be used in
-- SQL Joins to link between the ConversationUsers and ConversationMessages.
-- See the documentation for more information.

Conversation
    createdAt UTCTime -- conversations will be created when a user first sends a
      -- ConversationMessage to one or more users.
    updatedAt UTCTime Maybe
      -- this field will be updated every time a new message is posted to the
      -- conversation.
      -- Depending on how well this works, we may want to get rid of this field
      -- entirely and get this information solely from the most recent
      -- ConversationMessage entity.
